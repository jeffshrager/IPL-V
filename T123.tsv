	This program tests the interpreter's basic	5			00				
	call stack management. When it's run, the		T123		11	L1		1	1
	lines should execute in ID-number order,					J151		2	2
	execept that those called "n->" should be 					9-1		3->	3->
	followed by calling n, so, for example,					J0		12	12
	this line (13->) should be called after 					9-2		13->	13->
	12, and should be followed by 13. The					J0	0	15	15
	last line is 15, after which the thing		9-1		11	L2		3	3
	should end normally. Note that the line					J151		4	4
	with ID 6&9 should execute TWICE, first					9-3		5->	5->
	as th 6th instructions, and again as the 9th				11	L5		10	10
	one (that is, first after 5 and before 7,					J151	0	11	11
	and then again after 8 and before 10).		9-2		11	L3		13	13
	After completes, the stacks should be:					J151	0	14	14
