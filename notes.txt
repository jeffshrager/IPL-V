20260201: Problems being rejected (apparently in M42):

~20260209: AntiGravity helped in this debugging process: The "REJECTED
PROBLEM" error was traced to M42 incorrectly aborting because it
detected a failure status (H5-) when attempting to generate symbols
from a newly created sublist. Inspecting the execution trace revealed
that the J100 generator was running with an H5- status inherited from
the preceding J64 (Insert After) instruction. A code review of J64
showed it failed to explicitly set H5+ upon success, allowing a
previous failure state to propagate and mistakenly signal termination
to the generator logic. I fixed this by ensuring J64 sets (H5+) on
completion and also patched J100 to correctly terminate if a
subprocess returns H5-, aligning it with standard IPL-V behavior.

~20260125: M54 seemed to be failing -- 10W1s lookekd wrong at R220 and
R260 11W1s, but apparently aren't. Solution: (need to review)
