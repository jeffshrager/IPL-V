=======================
;;; IPL-V List Copying Functions (Updated to Handle Q=2 Local Symbols)

;; In IPL-V, the Q=2 designation used to mark a symbol as "local" does not modify the symbol itself
;; or the cell it names. Instead, it is a property of the IPL word (cell) that contains the symbol in
;; its SYMB field. When the Q field of such a word is set to 2, it signals to the loader or copier
;; (e.g., during J74) that the symbol should be treated as localâ€”meaning it will be replaced with a
;; newly generated, unique name. This ensures the symbol is localized to the copied context and avoids
;; naming collisions. This behavior is described explicitly on:
;;   - Page 200, under J136: "The output (0) is the input (0) with Q = 2..."
;;   - Page 148: "If the SYMB field of a word is marked with Q=2, the loader recognizes it as a local symbol."
;;   - Page 29: "To create a local symbol... set Q=2 in the cell in which the name appears."
